# Artificial Intelligence
### These are Java programs that I created for my Artificial Intelligence course.

## Chatbot
A chatbot that uses unigram, bigram, and trigram language models to generate a response to user input.

## Ice
A program that uses gradient descent on climatology records to predict how many days Lake Mendota will be covered by ice.

## Klotski
A program that uses A* search to have the computer find the shortest path to victory in a game of Klotski.

## kNN
A program that uses a k-NN classifier to classify a set of words as either a machine, a fruit, or a Geopolitical Entity (gpe).

## Neural
A program that uses a neural network to preform binary classification.

## Ring Treblecross
A program that uses the min-max algorithm to have the computer play a game of (*n,k*)-Ring Treblecross against a human player.
